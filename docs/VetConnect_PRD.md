# Product Requirements Document: VetConnect PMS

**Project Name:** VetConnect (vet_connect)
**Date:** April 14, 2025
**Author:** Emma, Product Manager

## Requirements Summary

Create a modern Practice Management System (PMS) for veterinarians with primary focus on the Dutch market. The system needs to offer a modern, intuitive interface design that moves away from traditional navigation elements. Initial MVP should include a dashboard, dynamic appointment scheduler, and client/patient management functionality while supporting multi-tenancy for franchise operations. The system must be able to integrate with Animana by Idexx initially for backend services, with the ability to transition to our own backend in the future.

## 4. UI/UX Guidelines

### 4.1 Design Principles

The VetConnect PMS will follow these core design principles:

1. **Contextual Navigation**: Replace traditional menu structures with context-aware navigation that presents options based on the user's current task and role

2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Display information and options progressively as needed, reducing cognitive load and screen clutter

3. **Spatial Memory**: Leverage consistent spatial positioning to help users build muscle memory for common actions

4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Use color, size, and positioning to guide attention to the most important information and actions

5. **Streamlined Workflows**: Design workflows that minimize clicks and screen transitions to complete common tasks

### 4.2 Navigation Approach

Instead of traditional sidenav or topnav elements, VetConnect will implement:

1. **Action-Oriented Hub**: A central dashboard acting as a hub with quick-access to common actions and workflows

2. **Contextual Action Panels**: Dynamic action panels that appear based on the current context (patient view, scheduling, etc.)

3. **Breadcrumb Trails**: Visual indication of navigation path and easy backward navigation

4. **Quick Access Toolbar**: Persistent access to frequently used functions, customizable by user

5. **Search-Driven Navigation**: Powerful global search as a primary navigation method, with type-ahead suggestions and deep linking
