# VetConnect PMS System Design

## Implementation approach

Based on the Product Requirements Document (PRD), VetConnect PMS requires a modern, intuitive veterinary practice management system with a unique navigation approach, multi-tenancy support, and integration with Animana backend initially. The following implementation approach addresses these requirements:

### Key Technical Challenges

1. **Modern UI/UX without traditional navigation elements**: Creating an intuitive interface without standard navigation patterns requires careful design and implementation of context-aware components.

2. **Multi-tenant architecture with hierarchical structure**: Supporting franchise operations with proper data isolation while enabling centralized management.

3. **Animana integration and migration path**: Developing a robust integration layer that allows seamless transition between Animana backend and our native backend.

4. **Role-based experiences**: Delivering optimized interfaces for different user roles while maintaining consistency.

### Technology Selection

#### Frontend

- **React**: For building a component-based UI with efficient state management
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid UI development with utility-first approach
- **Redux Toolkit**: For global state management with simplified Redux implementation
- **React Query**: For efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations and transitions
- **React Router**: For client-side routing and navigation
- **Storybook**: For component development and documentation

#### Backend

- **ASP.NET Core 8**: For building scalable and high-performance API services
- **Entity Framework Core**: For ORM and data access
- **AutoMapper**: For object-to-object mapping
- **MediatR**: For implementing CQRS pattern
- **Hangfire**: For background processing and scheduled tasks
- **SignalR**: For real-time notifications and updates

#### Database

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database with robust multi-tenant support
- **Redis**: For caching and distributed session management
- **Marten**: For document storage within PostgreSQL for flexible schema needs

#### DevOps & Infrastructure

- **Docker**: For containerization of application components
- **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration and scaling
- **Azure**: For cloud hosting and managed services
- **Azure API Management**: For API gateway functionality
- **Azure Key Vault**: For secrets management
- **Azure Application Insights**: For monitoring and telemetry

### Architecture Patterns

1. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with domain-driven design principles
2. **CQRS Pattern**: Separating read and write operations for scalability and performance
3. **API Gateway Pattern**: Routing requests between VetConnect frontend and Animana backend
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: For loose coupling between system components
5. **Repository Pattern**: Abstracting data access details from business logic

## Data structures and interfaces

A detailed class diagram representing the core entities and their relationships in the VetConnect system follows. These data structures are designed to support the multi-tenant architecture, role-based access control, and integration with Animana.

## Program call flow

The sequence diagrams illustrate the key workflows in the VetConnect system, including user authentication, appointment scheduling, patient management, and Animana integration.

## Multi-tenancy approach

VetConnect implements a robust multi-tenant architecture to support veterinary franchise operations:

### Tenant Hierarchy Model

- **Franchise Level**: Top-level tenant containing shared settings and protocols
- **Practice Level**: Individual clinics within a franchise
- **Department Level**: Specialized departments within larger practices

### Data Isolation Strategy

- **Schema-per-tenant**: Each tenant gets its own database schema
- **Tenant context middleware**: Identifies and validates tenant for each request
- **Row-level security**: Additional protection for shared database resources
- **Tenant-specific encryption**: Data encrypted with tenant-specific keys

### Shared Resource Management

- **Inheritance model**: Franchise-level defaults cascade to practices
- **Override tracking**: Modifications to shared resources are tracked
- **Versioning**: Changes to shared resources are versioned for audit purposes

## Animana Integration Architecture

The integration with Animana is designed to provide a seamless transition path:

### Integration Components

1. **API Gateway**: Routes requests between VetConnect frontend and appropriate backend
2. **Data Transformation Service**: Maps between VetConnect and Animana data models
3. **Synchronization Service**: Ensures data consistency between systems
4. **Conflict Resolution System**: Handles data conflicts during dual-system operation

### Integration Phases

1. **Frontend-Only Phase**: VetConnect frontend with complete Animana backend
2. **Hybrid Operation**: VetConnect backend for select modules with sync to Animana
3. **Full Migration**: Complete transition to VetConnect backend with legacy data

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

- **OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect**: For secure authentication
- **JWT tokens**: For stateless authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions based on user roles
- **Tenant-scoped permissions**: Access limited by tenant context

### Data Protection

- **TLS/SSL**: For transport security
- **At-rest encryption**: For stored data
- **Field-level encryption**: For sensitive PHI/PII
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking

## Modern UI/UX Approach

### Context-Aware Interface

- **Activity-based workspaces**: Dynamic organization around user tasks
- **Contextual actions**: Task-specific tools appear based on current activity
- **Spatial memory**: Consistent positioning to build user familiarity

### Navigation Strategy

- **Hub and spoke model**: Central dashboard with contextual workspaces
- **Breadcrumb visualization**: Clear path indicators for user orientation
- **Search-driven navigation**: Global search as primary navigation method
- **Path prediction**: AI-assisted suggestions for next likely actions

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **Animana API Specifics**: The PRD mentions integration with Animana but doesn't specify the available APIs, authentication mechanisms, or rate limits. This information is crucial for designing an effective integration layer.

2. **Regulatory Requirements**: While the PRD mentions GDPR compliance, specific Dutch veterinary regulatory requirements that might affect system design are not detailed.

3. **Data Migration Scope**: The exact scope of historical data migration from Animana to VetConnect backend needs clarification to design appropriate ETL processes.

4. **Specific Hardware Integration**: The system may need to interface with veterinary hardware (diagnostic equipment, etc.), but specific requirements are not provided.

5. **SLA Requirements**: Performance expectations, uptime requirements, and disaster recovery parameters are not specified in detail.
