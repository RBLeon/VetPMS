# VetConnect PMS System Design

## Implementation approach

After analyzing the requirements for VetConnect PMS, I've designed a comprehensive architecture that addresses the key challenges while enabling global scalability, extensive third-party integration capabilities, and role-specific adaptability. The system will follow modern software design practices with an API-first approach to maximize integration flexibility.

### Key Technical Considerations

1. **Multi-tenancy Architecture**: We'll implement a robust multi-tenant architecture that supports the hierarchical model (franchise → practice → department) with appropriate data isolation and shared capabilities.

2. **API-First Design**: All functionality will be exposed through well-documented, versioned APIs to enable seamless integration with third-party systems and support the eventual migration from Animana.

3. **Global Scalability**: The infrastructure will support deployment in multiple regions with data residency capabilities to meet various regulatory requirements globally.

4. **Integration Hub**: A centralized integration framework will facilitate connections to various third-party systems across multiple categories including:
   - Practice Management Systems (Animana, ezyVet, etc.)
   - Diagnostic Equipment and Laboratory Services
   - Billing and Financial Systems
   - Inventory Management Solutions
   - Client Communication Platforms
   - Medical Knowledge Bases and AI Services

5. **Role-Optimized UX**: The UI will dynamically adapt based on user roles (veterinarians, receptionists, practice managers, paravets), presenting relevant information and workflows without traditional navigation constraints.

2. **Webhooks**: For event-driven integrations
3. **File-based Integration**: For legacy systems that rely on file exchange
4. **Message Queues**: For asynchronous and reliable data exchange
5. **Database Replication**: For high-volume data synchronization scenarios

This flexible approach allows VetConnect to integrate with diverse systems, from modern cloud services to legacy on-premises applications, without being limited to specific integration technologies.

## Data structures and interfaces

The system is organized around several core domains that correspond to different aspects of veterinary practice management. Each domain contains related entities, services, and interfaces.

### Core Domains

1. **Identity and Access Management**
   - User management and authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Multi-tenant security

2. **Patient and Client Management**
   - Client (pet owner) information
   - Patient (animal) records
   - Medical history

3. **Appointment and Scheduling**
   - Calendar management
   - Resource allocation
   - Booking workflows

4. **Clinical Records**
   - Consultations and examinations
   - Treatments and procedures
   - Lab results and diagnostics

5. **Inventory Management**
   - Stock control
   - Medication management
   - Equipment tracking

6. **Billing and Payments**
   - Invoice generation
   - Payment processing
   - Insurance claims

7. **Integration Framework**
   - External system connectors
   - Data mapping and transformation
   - Synchronization services

8. **Franchise Management**
   - Cross-practice operations
   - Centralized knowledge
   - Franchise-wide analytics

### Integration Hub Architecture

The Integration Hub is a core component that enables VetConnect to work with various external systems. Its design allows for both the initial integration with Animana and future expansions to other systems.

Key components include:

1. **Connector Registry**: Maintains information about available connectors and their capabilities
2. **Data Mapping Service**: Transforms data between VetConnect's model and external systems
3. **Synchronization Engine**: Manages data synchronization processes, handling conflicts and errors
4. **Webhook Manager**: Processes incoming webhooks and dispatches events to appropriate handlers
5. **API Management**: Handles API versioning, rate limiting, and security

### Role-Based Interface Adaptation

The system implements a context-aware UI that adapts to user roles without requiring traditional navigation patterns. This is achieved through:

1. **UI Configuration Service**: Dynamically adjusts interface elements based on user role and preferences
2. **Workflow Engine**: Presents tailored workflows for specific user roles and scenarios
3. **Permission-Based Rendering**: Shows or hides UI elements based on user permissions
4. **Context-Aware Actions**: Presents relevant actions based on the current context (patient, appointment, etc.)

## Program call flow

The following sequence diagrams illustrate the key workflows in the VetConnect system.

### System Initialization and Tenant Creation

This flow demonstrates the creation of a franchise tenant and subsequent practice tenant:

1. System administrator initiates franchise tenant creation
2. System validates credentials and creates franchise record
3. System creates tenant admin account and assigns appropriate roles
4. Later, administrator adds practice tenant under the franchise
5. System establishes parent-child relationship between franchise and practice

### User Authentication and Role-Based UI Adaptation

This flow shows how users are authenticated and presented with role-optimized interfaces:

1. User attempts to access the application
2. System authenticates credentials
3. System retrieves user roles and permissions
4. For users with multiple tenants, system prompts for tenant selection
5. System generates UI configuration based on user role
6. User is presented with a role-optimized dashboard

### Appointment Scheduling with Resource Allocation

This flow depicts the process of scheduling an appointment:

1. Receptionist opens scheduler and sees existing appointments
2. System loads available resources (staff, rooms, equipment)
3. Receptionist selects client and patient
4. System calculates suggested appointment duration based on appointment type and patient history
5. Receptionist selects timeslot and resources
6. System validates resource availability
7. If resources are available, appointment is created and notifications sent
8. If conflicts exist, system suggests alternatives

### Animana Integration During Transition Period

This flow illustrates how VetConnect will integrate with Animana during the transition phase:

1. User requests patient data through VetConnect UI
2. System checks if data exists locally
3. If data is missing or stale, system fetches from Animana via API
4. Data is transformed and stored locally
5. When user updates data, changes are saved locally and synchronized to Animana

### One-Way Migration from Animana to VetConnect

This flow shows the eventual migration process from Animana to VetConnect's own backend:

1. Migration is initiated for a specific data domain (e.g., clients)
2. System extracts data from Animana
3. Data is transformed to VetConnect's model
4. System validates data integrity
5. Data is loaded into VetConnect's database
6. Verification is performed
7. System switches to using native backend for that domain

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **Animana API Capabilities**: The specific APIs available from Animana will ultimately determine the integration approach. We've designed a flexible system that can accommodate various integration scenarios, but detailed Animana API documentation would help refine the approach.

2. **Regulatory Requirements**: While we've designed for GDPR compliance and data residency, specific veterinary regulations in different countries may require additional considerations as the system expands globally.

3. **Third-Party Integration Priorities**: The system architecture supports extensive integration capabilities, but prioritization of which third-party systems to integrate first would help focus initial development efforts.

4. **Performance Requirements**: Specific performance requirements (number of concurrent users, response time expectations, etc.) would help refine the infrastructure design and scaling strategy.
