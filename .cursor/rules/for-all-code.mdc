# Code Development Rules

## Documentation First Approach
Before writing any code, developers must review the relevant documentation in the following locations:

### Core Documentation
- `/docs/VetPMS_PRD.md` - Product Requirements Document
- `/docs/vetpms-overview.md` - System Overview
- `/docs/vetpms-development-roadmap.md` - Development Timeline and Milestones

### Design Documentation
- `/docs/vetpms-frontend-design.md` - Frontend Architecture
- `/docs/vetpms-backend-design.md` - Backend Architecture
- `/docs/vetpms-data-design.md` - Data Model and Database Design
- `/docs/vetpms-ai-integration-design.md` - AI Integration Specifications

### MVP-Specific Documentation
When working on MVP features, refer to:
- `/docs/mvp/vetpms-mvp-design.md` - MVP Architecture and Design
- `/docs/mvp/vetpms-mvp-api.md` - MVP API Specifications
- `/docs/mvp/vetpms-mvp-ui-components.md` - MVP UI Component Library
- `/docs/mvp/vetpms-mvp-class-diagram.md` - MVP Class Structure
- `/docs/mvp/vetpms-mvp-sequence-diagram.md` - MVP Process Flows
- `/docs/mvp/vetpms-mvp-handoff.md` - MVP Handoff Documentation
- `/docs/mvp/vetpms-mvp-user-guide.md` - MVP User Guide

## Development Guidelines
1. Always start with the MVP documentation when no specific phase is mentioned
2. Ensure all code changes align with the product requirements and system design
3. Follow the development roadmap for feature prioritization
4. Maintain consistency with the established architecture patterns
5. Document any deviations from the design specifications

## Component Development
1. Before creating a new component:
   - Search the codebase for existing similar components
   - Review existing components' functionality and design
   - Consider enhancing existing components instead of creating new ones
   - If creating new components is necessary, ensure they follow the established patterns
2. When enhancing existing components:
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Document changes and improvements
   - Update tests to cover new functionality
   - Consider impact on related components

## Quality Assurance
1. Write tests before implementing features
2. Ensure all code changes are covered by appropriate tests
3. Follow the testing guidelines specified in the documentation
4. Maintain code quality standards as defined in the project documentation
