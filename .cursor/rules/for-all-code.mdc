# VetPMS Development Guidelines

## Core Documentation
- `vetpms-mvp-implementation-guide.md` - Primary MVP implementation guide with Refine.dev
- `api-documentation.md` - API specifications for both MVP and full version
- `strategic-roadmap.md` - Product strategy and feature prioritization
- `development-standards.md` - Code standards and development patterns
- `vetpms-integration-strategy.md` - Backend integration and migration approach

## Development Principles

1. **MVP Focus**: Follow the implementation guide for building the Minimum Viable Product
   - Use Refine.dev as outlined in the implementation guide
   - Begin with Supabase as temporary backend
   - Build toward eventual ASP.NET Core migration

2. **Component Development**
   - Utilize Refine.dev hooks and components for data operations
   - Follow the component patterns in the development standards document
   - Maintain consistent styling as specified in the standards

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Write tests for critical business logic
   - Use the test wrappers for Refine.dev components
   - Focus on pragmatic testing during MVP phase

4. **Quality Checks**
   - Run tests before submitting code
   - Verify builds complete successfully
   - Ensure TypeScript type safety
   - Check for console errors

5. **Code Organization**
   - Follow the project structure outlined in the implementation guide
   - Keep most feature code in the @features folder
   - Maintain clear separation between UI and data logic
