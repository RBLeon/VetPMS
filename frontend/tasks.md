  ```bash
  # For each feature, create standardized Refine.dev structure
  mkdir -p src/features/clients/{list,show,create,edit,components}
  mkdir -p src/features/patients/{list,show,create,edit,components}
  mkdir -p src/features/appointments/{list,show,create,edit,components}
  mkdir -p src/features/medical-records/{list,show,create,edit,components}

## Notes

- Run `pnpm build` after each significant change
- Test each feature thoroughly before moving to the next
- Always check for existing functionality before creating new components
- Focus on adapting and reusing existing code where possible
- Replace old code with new Refine.dev code once verified working
- Focus on core functionality first, additional features can be added later
- Maintain consistent error handling and loading states
- Follow Refine.dev best practices for each feature
- Remove old code once new code is verified working
- Evaluate each file for reusability before creating a new version
- When reusing code, maintain consistent patterns and naming conventions
- Preserve all role-specific dashboards and feature logic
- Maintain multi-tenant support in all features
- Keep existing UI customization and theming
